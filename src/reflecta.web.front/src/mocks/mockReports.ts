            "systemCompletion": "The 'No live energy' life saving rule applies to the prevention of incidents involving situations where electrical, mechanical or other types of energy are not properly managed or isolated.\n\nConsequences of failing to apply this rule are severe and have resulted in a myriad of incidents across different sectors in the company. These consequences included electric shocks (_Incident ID: 637_), short circuits and subsequent fire (_Incident ID: 530_, _1950_, _625_), equipment explosions (_Incident ID: 1706_), and even injuries from the release of mechanical energy (_Incident ID: 485_).\n\nOne of the reasons for the non-adherence to this rule includes a lack of proper communication (_Incident ID: 637_), which unfortunately, seems to be a frequent offender. This lapse in communication leads to individuals unknowingly working in hazardous conditions where live energy is present.\n\nAnother key reason noted from incident reports is the assumption that certain safety steps or precautions may not be necessary. This is highlighted by the failure to verify the absence of voltage or 'proving dead' in certain cases (_Incident ID: 1950_, _1928_, _1814_). Often, these assumptions tend to be incorrect, directly leading to incidents.\n\nFurther, we also note instances were mistakes were made in identifying the right power source (_Incident ID: 1928_), as well as failing to report potentially hazardous situations (_Incident ID: 620_), which could also contribute to why the 'No live energy' rule isn't being applied as much as it should be.\n\nOverall, it appears that there are often gaps in knowledge, execution of safety procedures, communication, and sometimes, simple negligence, that contribute to the failure to adhere to the 'No live energy' rule. These factors combined with the inherent unpredictability of live energy sources can lead to the severe consequences observed in the aforementioned incidents.",

            "systemCompletion": "The top 3 injuries related to head injuries are:\n\n1. **Falling Objects**: As observed in incidents _604_, _1454_, and _1936_, head injuries can occur due to falling objects. This can include ceiling tiles in a building or even disconnected parts from a drill or structure. To prevent these types of injuries, it is crucial to regularly maintain and ensure the stability of all equipment and building structures. Also, use of personal protective equipment such as helmets and hard hats can offer an added layer of safety.\n\n2. **Heavy Equipment Accidents**: In incident _1741_, the victim was crushed between a truck and its dumpster, resulting in a head injury. This suggests the potential dangers of working around heavy machinery or equipment, especially mobile ones. Safety recommendation for preventing this type of incident would be efficient communication between workers and machine operators, making sure the area is clear before commencing operation, observing safe distance from operating machinery, and wearing appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment). \n\n3. **Falls**: Falls can also lead to head injuries, as portrayed in incidents _1687_  and _518_. Here, an employee was injured after falling off a platform or the object dropping on his head. To avoid similar incidents, ensure proper equipment stability and have efficient safety measures in place. Workers should also wear suitable PPE and be properly trained in handling equipment. In slippery or high-rise areas, use of barriers, railings and adhering to basic fall protection measures could prove helpful. \n\nRemember, all incidents can be further mitigated by ensuring workers receive relevant safety training and understand the importance of PPE and other safety protocols. \n",

            "systemCompletion": "Based on the provided incidents, the following risks can be identified as the top 5 since January 2023, along with their related learnings:\n\n1. **Vehicle Accidents**: Incidents such as collisions, overturns, or other accidents involving vehicles (for instance, incidents _1981_, _1742_, _1818_, _1711_, and _1893_), indicate a significant risk. The learning here is to increase safe driving training, enforce the use of safety belts, improve vehicle maintenance and possibly install safety devices on vehicles to prevent these incidents.\n\n2. **Electrical Shocks**: Electrical shocks arising from malfunctions or incorrect handling of electrical equipment pose a major risk (incidents _1950_, _530_, _1950_, _1726_, and _1928_). The learning is that safe work practices should be adhered to when handling electrical equipment, including wearing correct PPE, isolating power sources before handling equipment and verifying that equipment is not live.\n\n3. **Falling from Height**: Instances where individuals fell from a certain height or level due to accidents or equipment failures (such as incidents _1866_, _1568_, _1564_, _1946_, and _1574_) indicate a high-risk scenario. Safety measures like using appropriate fall protection equipment, regularly inspecting and maintaining work equipment and providing adequate safety training will help reduce this risk.\n\n4. **Fire Incidents**: Situations where a fire broke out due to electrical faults, hot work or other reasons (incidents _1951_, _1787_, _1934_, _1451_,_1872_) are quite serious. The learning here is that sufficient fire safety measures, careful hot-work procedures and regular equipment inspections should be implemented.\n\n5. **Physical Injuries during Work**: There are numerous instances of employees getting injured during their regular work tasks due to equipment failure, lack of personal protective equipment, or unsafe working environment (instances _1882_, _1451_, _1820_, _1711_ and _1936_). The learning from this is that the use of personal protective equipment should be emphasized, safety training reinforced, and working environments made safe to prevent such incidents.\n\nThese risks and the learnings identified from related incidents should be crucial in reforming health and safety procedures to prevent future occurrences.",

            "systemCompletion": "Failure to adhere to the 'No live energy' life-saving rule can result in severe adverse impacts, including electrical shocks, short-circuits, fires, explosions, and injuries from reactive mechanical energy (e.g. springs). Consequences range from minor injuries to potentially fatal incidents (see incidents with IDs _637_, _530_, _485_, _1928_, _1814_, _1706_, _525_, _454_, _1935_, _620_, _1791_, _1715_, and _1734_ for examples).\n\nSeveral reasons counteract the application of this crucial rule:\n\n1. **Communication lapses and disregard for policies** - This resulted in mishaps like electricity shock due to lack of coordination and respect for established safety rules (_Incident 637_). \n\n2. **Failure to adequately protect or isolate energized structures** - This led to instances of short-circuits and related risks, posing safety threats to the employees involved (_Incidents 530_, _1608_, _454_, _620_, and _1715_).\n\n3. **Assumptions and lack of checks to verify absence of energy** - One of the highlights is the absence of 'proving dead' where employees assumed that parts were non-energized and hence, didn't use necessary protective measures (_Incidents 1928_ and _1814_).\n\n4. **Contact with energized structures while performing maintenance work** - Several incidents demonstrate the risk of dealing with live energy during repair or replacement procedures (_Incidents 1706_, _525_, _1935_, _1791_, and _1734_).\n\n5. **Unsafe working conditions and practices** - Such as working close to highly energized and potentially dangerous structures (_Incident 1715_), can put employees at risk.\n\nThe key takeaway is the necessity to strictly adhere to the 'No live energy' rule to prevent avoidable safety risks. This entails effective communication, ensuring proper safety measures, double-checking the energy status of equipment before handling, and adhering to safe working practices.\n",

            "systemCompletion": "The consequences of not applying the 'No live energy' life-saving rule are visible in various ways, as reported by several incidents in the company. \n\nFirstly, not adhering to this rule can lead to dangerous situations such as fires, as the incident _1950_ refers to, where a worker caused an electric arc which ignited a fire in an electrical cabinet simply by not verifying the absence of current in an electrical cabinet. It brings to light the potential risk to property and life if workers do not adhere to the 'No live energy' rule. Other instances of fire due to neglecting this rule include incidents _525_ and _1791_. \n\nElectrical shock is another significant consequence. In instance _637_, a lapse in communication and ignoring the policy led to a worker being electrocuted. The same occurred in incident _1928_, where the technician failed to wear dielectric gloves and confirm the lack of power for the second emergency lighting block. \n\nFurthermore, ignoring the safety rule can lead to unintended injuries as was the case of _485_. The decontamination officer was struck after releasing contained mechanical energy. This shows that not only electrical, but different forms of live energy also need to be accounted for when using the 'No live energy' rule. \n\nThere are physical damages caused as well, like in _530_ where a short-circuit occurred between a busbar and a piece, causing disruption to operations. \n\nApproximately 15 out of 20 incidents had some sort of negative impact due to not observing the 'No Live Energy' rule. The primary reasons include negligence, lack of adequate communication, and inadequate training or understanding of safety guidelines. \n\nWhile the examples are abundant, commonly the rule is not applied due to time pressure, a perceived lack of necessary tools, understaffed teams, or simply ignorance or neglect of the existing regulations. Hence, ensuring that workers are well-educated about the importance of this life-saving rule and establishing strict adherence protocols could reduce incidents and foster a safer working environment.",

            "systemCompletion": "The consequences of not applying the 'No live energy' life saving rule are made evident through several incidents. For each occurrence, it appears communication lapses, improper risk assessments, and lack of adherence to safety protocols often contribute to the incidents.\n\nIn some cases, such as incidents _637_, _530_, _1950_, _620_, _525_, _1928_, _1791_, & _1935_, the individuals involved experienced or caused electrical shocks or fires as a result of making contact with energized equipment. While some employees were not physically harmed, the serious potential for bodily harm is exhibited, including shock, burns and the possibility of lethal injuries.\n\nAnother serious outcome can be damages to equipment, as presented in incidents _1950_, _525_, & _1791_. In these instances, electrical arcs and short circuits resulted in fire, potentially causing significant financial losses. It also potentially disrupts the operation of businesses or services.\n\nFailure to observe the 'No live energy' rule not only endangers individuals and equipment, it can furthermore lead to considerable incidents as shown in incidents _1706_ & _1620_, where a short circuit led to a light explosion, and grounding a gas installation caused the risk of electric current in the work area.\n\nThe incidents also clearly show how easy it is to overlook the necessity of this rule. As seen in incidents _1928_, _1814_, & _2005_, employees often neglect to use adequate personal protective equipment or take necessary precautions, thinking they've isolated the energy in the area. Similarly, in incidents _485_, _1608_, _533_, _626_, _1907_, _1734_, & _2000_, incidents occurred across a wide range of scenarios from the decontamination of equipment, to attempted repair jobs, and construction activities.\n\nFrom these incidents, it is apparent that the failure to apply the 'No live energy' rule can lead to dangerous situations, including bodily harm, equipment damage, service malfunction, and even the risk of life-threatening scenarios. There seems to be some negligence or lack of awareness in making correct and consistent applications of the rule, indicating a need for more effective implementation and regular reinforcement.\n",

            "systemCompletion": "The 'No live energy' life-saving rule primarily seeks to avoid accidents by mandating that sources of energy should not be live or active during maintenance, repair, or other such intrusive work. However, non-compliance with this rule can lead to severe outcomes, as exemplified by the following incidents.\n\nFirstly, electric shocks are a common consequence, as seen in incident _1928_, where a technician received a shock during maintenance work, or in _1814_ where an employee received an electric shock during a replacement operation. Similarly, _637_ mentions a worker getting shocked due to a laps in communication and not following the policy. In many of these cases where this lifestyle saving rule is not followed, an incorrect assumption about the energy status of a system can lead to harmful consequences.\n\nSecondly, non application of the 'No live energy' rule can cause fire-related accidents. Incident _1950_ is a clear illustration of this when a fire broke out in an electrical cabinet after manipulations in the absence of current check. Incident _525_ describes an electrical circuit short, once again indicating a failure to adhere to the rule. This incident points towards the additional danger of possible injuries from falling, especially when working at heights.\n\nThe consequences can also be catastrophic in terms of equipment damage and large-scale accidents. Incident _454_ notes an electrical arc flash during a cutting operation when the tool touched a high voltage electrical cable. Episode _1907_ describes an accident where an alignment pump inadvertently started, leading to the breakage of equipment and the possibility of injury to workers. _1715_, on the other hand, points towards a serious risk of the scaffolding support beams getting within the safety zone of a 150kV transformer.\n\nAs for why the 'No live energy' rule is not applied as frequently as it should be, analysis of these incidents suggests several reasons. On the most basic level, some employees may simply be unaware of the rule or fail to recognize its importance. Other times, employees may make incorrect assumptions about the energy status of the system on which they are working, as seen in incidents _1928_ and _1814_. Poor communication, as seen in incident _637_, can also be a critical factor inhibiting the application of this rule. \n\nFurthermore, the incidents suggest cases of using inappropriate PPEs and tools for handling live energy systems, which indicates a lack of adequate training or neglect for safety rules on part of workers. In some cases, employees might also neglect to follow this rule because they are under pressure to complete tasks quickly, as suggested in _1706_, where a small explosion occurred despite double-checking absence of voltage.\n\nIn this light, while it is not possible to prevent all accidents, strict adherence to the 'No live energy' rule can mitigate many risks associated with maintenance-related tasks in an energy-rich environment, and actions are needed to raise its adoption rate.",

The 'No live energy' rule also helps prevent incidents like short circuits (_Incidents ID: 530, 525, 1706_) that can cause further damage to equipment and potentially lead to fires. Moreover, a laps in following this rule can cause complications during operations where live energy is present, such as during installations (_Incidents ID: 1814, 1928_).\n\nAdditionally, failure in adhering to this rule can lead to unexpected electrical outbursts, causing damage to physical assets and pose a potential risk to the safety of employees present on site (_Incidents ID: 1950, 1935_). Moreover, such negligence can also result in employees getting injured while manipulating electrical equipment (_Incidents ID: 1791, 485_).\n\nNon-adherence to the 'No live energy' rule is often due to lack of communication, decision to go against policy (_Incident ID: 637_), absence of suitable protective equipment and wrongly assumed safety assumptions (_Incident ID: 1928_), or a misunderstanding of the electrical circuits and equipment one is working with (_Incidents ID: 620, 1620_).\n\nIn conclusion, the 'No live energy' rule is crucial in maintaining safety in the workplace and preventing accidents. Its non-application can result in severe consequences including equipment failure, electrical fires, and human injuries. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that all employees are aware of this rule and its importance, and to ensure that they adhere to it at all times, regardless of the circumstances.\n",

            "systemCompletion": "The 'No live energy' rule is a safety rule in workplaces that prohibits coming into contact with any sort of live energy including electrical energy, spring energy, and even gas energy before its isolation or de-energization. The consequences of not applying this rule can be quite serious and sometimes, fatal.\n\nBased on the incidents reported, the most recurrent consequence of not applying the 'No live energy' rule includes electrical short-circuits causing fires. This is evident from incidents _525_, _530_, _1950_, _1928_, _1935_, _1791_, and _2000_. These incidents typically caused imminent threats to life and property, which included physical injuries to employees, property damage, interruption of work, leading to significant financial losses.\n\nAnother grave consequence reported is exposure to live energy leading to electrical shock as demonstrated in incidents _1928_, _637_, _1814_, _1935_, and _1791_. This can lead to serious injuries, health complications, trauma, and in some cases, can prove to be fatal.\n\nThe neglect of the 'No live energy' rule has also caused accidents involving mechanical injuries like in incident _485_, gas leakages as in incidents _626_, _1620_, and _454_, and exposure to harmful chemicals, causing burns as in incident _1734_. These incidents evidently pose serious safety hazards, health risks, and work environment disruption.\n\nAs to why the 'No live energy' rule isn't as applied as it should be is attributed to several reasons. Notably, misunderstanding or assuming the energy source has been de-energized without proper verification was observed in incidents _1950_, _1928_, _533_, and _1706_. Miscommunication, lack of proper coordination, non-compliance with policies, and carelessness among team members as in incidents _530_ and _637_ also led to a lack of application of the rule. Furthermore, the absence of proper and up-to-date diagrams as in incident _1928_ and use of inappropriate tools and equipment as observed in incidents _626_, _1620_, and _454_ also played significant roles in incidents related to 'No live energy'. \n\nIn conclusion, neglecting the 'No live energy' rule can have serious, sometimes fatal, consequences. Issues like miscommunication, assumptions about energy state, non-compliance with policies, and use of inappropriate tools contribute to its lack of application, highlighting a serious need for strict adherence to safety procedures.",

            "systemCompletion": "Not adhering to the 'No live energy' life saving rule can lead to various negative consequences as seen in Incident IDs _1907_ and _620_. \n\nIn Incident _1907_, the maintenance work was being conducted on a pump while it was still connected to live energy. This resulted in automatic starting of the backup pump and the rotation of the pump under maintenance, leading to damage to the alignment tool and posing a risk to the workers due to the ejection of parts from the tool.\n\nIncident _620_ involves a case where a worker unknowingly cut a live, energized cable while drilling a partition. The cable was not reported to be cut and only discovered days later by the maintenance company when the power outlet was non-functional. This could have easily led to an electrocution hazard due to the undetected live wire.\n\nA potential reason why the 'No live energy' rule is not applied as often as it should be can be inferred from these incidents. It may be due to a lack of awareness or negligence on the part of the workers. As seen in both the incidents, proper checks were not conducted to ensure the energy was not live before starting the tasks. In the case of Incident _620_, the worker even neglected to report the cut cable, indicating a possible lack of understanding about the potential hazards of not adhering to the 'No live energy' rule. \n\nThis highlights the need for increased training and awareness among workers about the potential risks and adherence to lifesaving rules, particularly the 'No live energy' rule. Consequences of not doing so can cause property damage, potentially serious injuries, and increased downtime due to unforeseen equipment failures.",

            "systemCompletion": "The 'No live energy' rule pertains to securing and disabling all sources of energy before starting work on equipment or systems, essentially ensuring that no live or active energy is present. This prevents energy release that can cause serious, sometimes fatal, injuries such as electrical shocks, burns, fire, and mechanical strikes due to the sudden discharge of stored energy. The consequences of not applying this rule are varied and sometimes quite severe. They often lead to a dramatic escalation of hazard situations, often resulting in personnel injuries.\n\nFrom the incidents documented, a breach of the 'No live energy' rule often leads to unintended energy releases. For instance, in _Incident ID: 485_, the failure to properly deactivate the mechanical energy stored in a spring led to it striking the officer's face. In _Incident ID: 1935_, touch interaction with accessible, live, electrical cable cores led to the formation of an electric arc that resulted in injury.\n\nElectrical shocks are another common consequence, ranging from mild to severe. In _Incident ID: 637_, a lapse in communication and violation of policy led one worker to get shocked. Similarly, in _Incident ID: 1928_, an assumption about circuit connections led the technician to get a shock. Another similar case was _Incident ID: 1814_, where the worker was shocked due to making contact with a live wire.\n\nIn some cases, such as _Incident ID: 1950_ and _Incident ID: 1791_, the failure to comply with the 'No live energy' rule led to the occurrence of electric arcs causing a fire, which luckily did not harm the worker in the former incident.\n\nThe reason for under-applying this rule often revolves around complacency, assumptions, or lack of communication. For example, in _Incident ID: 1928_, the technician assumed that because two fixtures were placed close to each other, they were on the same circuit, which resulted in a violation of the rule. Poor communication featured in _Incident ID: 637_, where a lack of proper coordination led to an electrical shock. Lastly, in multiple incidents, simple complacency and lack of proper procedure adherence resulted in non-compliance with this critical safety rule.\n   \nEnsuring understanding, adherence, and constant communication of the importance and procedures related to the 'No live energy' rule can help avoid these dangerous occurrences. Lack of adherence to this rule escalates hazards and risks, and it is crucial to minimize these incidents.",

            "systemCompletion": "The 'No live energy' life saving rule is designed to prevent injury or death from electrical shocks, short circuits, explosion or fire caused by live energy in the workplace. Ignoring this rule can lead to several dire consequences as demonstrated by the listed incidents. \n\nSome of the consequences include:\n1. Electrical shock experienced by workers due to lapses in communication or refusal to follow policy. This can result in serious bodily harm or even death (_Incident 637_).\n\n2. Short circuits caused by non-adherence to the 'No live energy' rule have been shown to cause fires, which can endanger workers and damage equipment. These incidents could be prevented with adherence to the rule (_Incidents 525, 1950_).\n\n3. Accidents involving live energy can also lead to explosions. This is demonstrated where a tool made contact with the poles of a capacitor, causing a light explosion (_Incident 1706_).\n\nThe 'No live energy’ rule may not be applied as frequently as it should due to several reasons:\n\n1. Lack of communication and proper coordination among team members, as indicated in several incidents. Workers may ignore or be unaware of the live energy in their work area (_Incidents 637, 620, 1928_).\n\n2. Misjudgment or complacency can result in accidents where workers incorrectly assume that equipment or lines are not live, resulting in dangerous encounters with live energy (_Incidents 1928, 1814_).\n\n3. In some cases, a lack of proper safety equipment such as dielectric gloves or a suitable helmet with a face shield may discourage the application of the rule (_Incident 1928_). Lack of a safe environment could also play a critical role in adherence to the rule (_Incident 1715_). \n\n4. Time pressure or convenience may encourage workers to circumvent 'No live energy' precautions, especially in cases where the work might be faster or easier with a live energy supply (_Incidents 525, 1950_).\n\nIn conclusion, non-adherence to the 'No live energy' life saving rule can lead to significant harm to personnel and damage to equipment. Factors such as miscommunication, complacency, lack of appropriate safety equipment and time pressures often contribute to neglect of the 'No live energy' rule.",

            "systemCompletion": "The 'No live energy' rule is a crucial safety measure that mandates any energy source should be appropriately deactivated before any operations or maintenance work is commenced. This is to prevent hazardous incidents such as electrical shocks, fires, explosions and other severe implications that can result in injuries, fatalities or equipment damage.\n\n**Consequences of not Applying 'No Live Energy' Rule**\n\nBased on the incidents from the dataset, not adhering to the 'No live energy' rule can lead to:\n\n1. Electric Shocks and Electrical Burns: Workers who come into direct contact with live energy sources often suffer from electric shocks. This can result in major or minor injuries depending on the voltage of the energy source, as seen in incidents _1740_, _525_, _530_, _1928_, _1726_, _637_, and _1935_.\n\n2. Fire and Explosion: Live energy sources can cause fires or explosions if they come into contact with flammable materials or are mishandled. This dangerous scenario can be seen in incidents _525_, _1950_, and _1791_.\n\n3. Damage to Equipment: Not turning off energy sources can also lead to serious damage to equipment, causing expensive and time-consuming repairs or replacements, and loss of operational time, as highlighted in incidents _525_, _1950_, and _1791_.\n\n4. Panic and Accidents: Unexpected equipment behaviour caused by live energy can lead to panic and result in accidents. This is evident in incidents like _1442_ where a worker got injured while trying to escape a concerning situation.\n\n**Reasons for Not Applying 'No Live Energy' Rule**\n\nSeveral reasons can be identified for not applying the 'No live energy' rule as much as it should be from the incidents' dataset:\n\n1. Inadequate Risk Analysis: Some incidents occurred because preliminary risk analyses didn't flag the presence of live energy in equipments. This was the case in incident _1740_.\n\n2. Lack of Clear Communication: Insufficient communication between teams or between managers and employees can lead to situations where energy sources are not properly shut down, as was the case in incident _530_.\n\n3. Misjudgements and Assumptions: Misjudgements or assumptions about energy sources being deactivated led to accidents in incidents _1928_ and _1715_.\n\n4. Non-compliance with Safety Procedures: Incorporated safety procedures were overlooked or bypassed in incidents _1620_, _626_, and _1511_, leading to risky conditions.\n\n5. Lack of Appropriate Training: The lack of appropriate training in how to handle live energy tools/equipments and safety measures to take can also result in accidents, as shown in incident _620_.\n\nIn summary, it's clear that adherence to the 'No live energy' rule is critical for the health and safety of everyone in the worksite, as well as for the smooth operation and preservation of the equipment. Enhancing safety trainings and communication, including a more thorough risk analysis, and ensuring compliance with the established safety procedures can help in increasing the application of the 'No live energy' rule effectively.",
